The operational constraints have a huge impact on the observing strategy, data products and download.  The full daytime available power is 100W, which reduces to 40W at night, and the expected download capacity is 100 GB/month.  The expected on-board memory will be between 10-20 TB.  The beamformer and individual antennas will produce dual-linear polarizations.  The spectrometer will have two general modes:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item ring-buffer triggered baseband
    \item pseudo-Stokes spectra of varying spectral/temporal resolution.
\end{itemize}
