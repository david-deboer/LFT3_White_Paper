	abstract = {Recent observations strongly suggest that the millisecond pulsar binary PSR J1023+0038 has developed an accretion disk since 2013 June. We present a multi-wavelength analysis of PSR J1023+0038, which reveals that (1) its gamma-rays suddenly brightened within a few days in 2013 June/July and has remained at a high gamma-ray state for several months; (2) both UV and X-ray fluxes have increased by roughly an order of magnitude; and (3) the spectral energy distribution has changed significantly after the gamma-ray sudden flux change. Time variabilities associated with UV and X-rays are on the order of 100–500 s and 50–100 s, respectively. Our model suggests that a newly formed accretion disk, due to the sudden increase of the stellar wind, could explain the changes of all these observed features. The increase of UV is emitted from the disk, and a new component in gamma-rays is produced by inverse Compton scattering between the new UV component and pulsar wind. The increase of X-rays results from the enhancement of injection pulsar wind energy into the intra-binary shock due to the increase of the stellar wind. We also predict that the radio pulses may be blocked by the evaporated winds from the disk, and the pulsar is still powered by rotation.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that, when the pressure within stellar matter becomes high enough, a new phase consisting of neutrons will be formed. In this paper we study the gravitational equilibrium of masses of neutrons, using the equation of state for a cold Fermi gas, and general relativity. For masses under 13⊙ only one equilibrium solution exists, which is approximately described by the nonrelativistic Fermi equation of state and Newtonian gravitational theory. For masses 13⊙{\textless}m{\textless}34⊙ two solutions exist, one stable and quasi-Newtonian, one more condensed, and unstable. For masses greater than 34⊙ there are no static equilibrium solutions. These results are qualitatively confirmed by comparison with suitably chosen special cases of the analytic solutions recently discovered by Tolman. A discussion of the probable effect of deviations from the Fermi equation of state suggests that actual stellar matter after the exhaustion of thermonuclear sources of energy will, if massive enough, contract indefinitely, although more and more slowly, never reaching true equilibrium.},

	abstract = {We present Chandra X-Ray Observatory imaging observations of the young Galactic supernova remnant G11.2-0.3. The image shows that the previously known young 65 ms X-ray pulsar is at position (J2000) R.A. 18h11m29.22s, decl. -19°25'27.6", with 1 σ error radius of 0.6". This is within 8" of the geometric center of the shell. This provides strong confirming evidence that the system is younger, by a factor of {\textasciitilde}12, than the characteristic age of the pulsar. The age discrepancy suggests that pulsar characteristic ages can be poor age estimators for young pulsars. Assuming conventional spin-down with constant magnetic field and braking index, the most likely explanation for the age discrepancy in G11.2-0.3 is that the pulsar was born with a spin period of {\textasciitilde}62 ms. The Chandra image also reveals, for the first time, the morphology of the pulsar wind nebula. The elongated hard X-ray structure can be interpreted as either a jet or a Crab-like torus seen edge-on. This adds to the growing list of highly aspherical pulsar wind nebulae and argues that such structures are common around young pulsars.},

For single stars, stellar winds are the only means of mass loss, and these are a function of the metallicity of the star. We discuss how metallicity, and a simplified prescription for its effect on mass loss, affects the evolution and final fate of massive stars. We map, as a function of mass and metallicity, where black holes and neutron stars are likely to form and where different types of supernovae are produced. Integrating over an initial mass function, we derive the relative populations as a function of metallicity. Provided that single stars rotate rapidly enough at death, we speculate on stellar populations that might produce gamma-ray bursts and jet-driven supernovae.},

	abstract = {The structure of neutron stars is considered from theoretical and observational perspectives. We demonstrate an important aspect of neutron star structure: the neutron star radius is primarily determined by the behavior of the pressure of matter in the vicinity of nuclear matter equilibrium density. In the event that extreme softening does not occur at these densities, the radius is virtually independent of the mass and is determined by the magnitude of the pressure. For equations of state with extreme softening or those that are self-bound, the radius is more sensitive to the mass. Our results show that in the absence of extreme softening, a measurement of the radius of a neutron star more accurate than about 1 km will usefully constrain the equation of state. We also show that the pressure near nuclear matter density is primarily a function of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy, while the nuclear incompressibility and skewness parameters play secondary roles. In addition, we show that the moment of inertia and the binding energy of neutron stars, for a large class of equations of state, are nearly universal functions of the star's compactness. These features can be understood by considering two analytic, yet realistic, solutions of Einstein's equations, by, respectively, Buchdahl and Tolman. We deduce useful approximations for the fraction of the moment of inertia residing in the crust, which is a function of the stellar compactness and, in addition, the pressure at the core-crust interface.},

	abstract = {The matter in neutron stars is essentially in its ground state and ranges in density up to and beyond 3 × 1014 g/cm3, the density of nuclear matter. Here we determine the constitution of the ground state of matter and its equation of state in the regime from 4.3 × 1011 g/cm3 where free neutrons begin to “drip” out of the nuclei, up to densities ≈ 5 × 1014 g/cm3, where standard nuclear-matter theory is still reliable. We describe the energy of nuclei in the free neutron regime by a compressible liquid-drop model designed to take into account three important features: (i) as the density increases, the bulk nuclear matter inside the nuclei, and the pure neutron gas outside the nuclei become more and more alike; (ii) the presence of the neutron gas reduces the nuclear surface energy; and (iii) the Coulomb interaction between nuclei, which keeps the nuclei in a lattice, becomes significant as the spacing between nuclei becomes comparable to the nuclear radius. We find that nuclei survive in the matter up to a density ∼ 2.4 × 1014 g/cm3; below this point we find no tendency for the protons to leave the nuclei. The transition between the phase with nuclei and the liquid phase at higher densities occurs as follows. The nuclei grow in size until they begin to touch; the remaining density inhomogeneity smooths out with increasing density until it disappears at about 3 × 1014 g/cm3 in a first-order transition. It is shown that the uniform liquid is unstable against density fluctuations below this density; the wave-length of the most unstable density fluctuation is close to the limiting lattice constant in the nuclear phase.},

Others relate directly to the physics of the pulsar and already shed some light on the properties of matter at high density (∼1015 g/cc) and in strong magnetic fields (∼1012 G). Pulsars are assumed to be rotating neutron stars surrounded by strong magnetic fields and energetic particles. It is somewhere within this "magnetosphere" that the pulsar action is expected to take place. Currently there has been considerable difficulty in formulating an entirely self-consistent theory of the magnetospheric behavior and there may be rapid revisions in the near future, which is all the more surprising since many of the issues involve "elementary" problems in electromagnetism. One interesting discovery is that charge-separated plasmas apparently can support stable static discontinuities.},

The PSC includes pulsar observers with expertise using the world's largest radio telescopes that together cover the full sky. We have performed very deep observations of all 35 pulsars discovered in blind frequency searches of the LAT data, resulting in the discovery of radio pulsations from four of them. We have also searched over 300 LAT gamma-ray sources that do not have strong associations with known gamma-ray emitting source classes and have pulsar-like spectra and variability characteristics. These searches have led to the discovery of a total of 43 new radio millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and four normal pulsars. These discoveries greatly increase the known population of MSPs in the Galactic disk, more than double the known population of so-called `black widow' pulsars, and contain many promising candidates for inclusion in pulsar timing arrays.},

The spatial location out of the Galactic plane and gamma-ray luminosity of the source are more consistent with classification as a recycled millisecond pulsar than as a young pulsar.

These are the most luminous flares seen in any non-accreting "spider" pulsar system, which may be related to the large size of the companion through the fraction of the pulsar wind that it or its ablated wind intercepts. Simultaneously with an optical flare, we see Balmer-line and He I emission, not previously known in this object, which is evidence of a stellar wind that may also inhibit detection of radio pulsations. The quiescent optical light curves, while dominated by ellipsoidal modulation, show evidence of variable non-uniform temperature that could be due either to large starspots or asymmetric heating of the companion by the pulsar. This may explain a previous measurement of unusual non-zero orbital eccentricity as, alternatively, distortion of the radial-velocity curve by the surface temperature distribution of the large companion.},

	abstract = {We have developed two new methods for finding binary pulsars that search complementary portions of parameter space. Both techniques examine small regions of the Fourier transform of a time series and identify the distinctive but very low signal-to-noise patterns produced by binary pulsars. The first technique is a Fourier-domain version of traditional "acceleration" searches which can coherently detect a binary pulsar if the orbital period is much longer than the observation time (Porb ≳ 10Tobs). Based on Fourier-domain matched filtering, it provides sensitivities similar to time domain versions, but with great computational advantages (i.e. greatly decreased memory usage, increased speed, and an inherently parallel nature) when the time series is very long ( ≳ 108 points). The second technique is a computationally "cheap" but incoherent search for binary pulsars where Porb ≲ ⅔Tobs. This search detects periodic sidebands created by orbital phase modulation of a binary pulsar's signal using a two-stage Fourier analysis. Sideband searches have the potential to detect very interesting exotic pulsar systems in ultra-compact binaries that would be impossible to detect using traditional techniques. We have implemented both searches along with many other advanced Fourier "tricks" into a suite of pulsar search software called PRESTO . Using this software we have discovered a very interesting 3 ms binary pulsar with a 102 m orbital period and a ∼10 MJupiter companion in the globular cluster NGC 6544, a most-likely isolated 4.71 ms pulsar in the globular cluster Terzan 5, and have confirmed the new 65.6 ms X-ray pulsar discovered in the supernova remnant 3C 58.},

Transitional systems that showed changes from rotation-powered to accretion-powered states and vice versa have bridged the populations of radio and accreting millisecond pulsars, eventually demonstrating the tight evolutionary link envisaged by the recycling scenario. A decade of discoveries and theoretical efforts have just grasped the complex phenomenology of transitional millisecond pulsars from the radio to the gamma-ray bands. This chapter summarizes the main properties of the three transitional millisecond pulsars discovered so far, as well as of candidates and related systems, discussing the various models proposed to cope with their multifaceted behaviour.},

A large fraction of these millisecond pulsars are in compact binaries with low-mass companions. These systems often show eclipses of the pulsar signal and are commonly known as black widows and redbacks because the pulsar is gradually destroying its companion. In this paper, we report on the optical discovery of four strongly irradiated millisecond pulsar companions. All four sources show modulations of their color and luminosity at the known orbital periods from radio timing. Light curve modeling of our exploratory data shows that the equilibrium temperature reached on the companion's dayside with respect to their nightside is consistent with about 10\%–30\% of the available spin-down energy from the pulsar being reprocessed to increase the companion's dayside temperature. This value compares well with the range observed in other irradiated pulsar binaries and offers insights about the energetics of the pulsar wind and the production of γ-ray emission. In addition, this provides a simple way of estimating the brightness of irradiated pulsar companions given the pulsar spin-down luminosity. Our analysis also suggests that two of the four new irradiated pulsar companions are only partially filling their Roche lobe. Some of these sources are relatively bright and represent good targets for spectroscopic follow-up. These measurements could enable, among other things, mass determination of the neutron stars in these systems.},

	abstract = {Reliable neutron star mass measurements are key to determining the equation of state of cold nuclear matter, but such measurements are rare. Black widows and redbacks are compact binaries consisting of millisecond pulsars and semi-degenerate companion stars. Spectroscopy of the optically bright companions can determine their radial velocities, providing inclination-dependent pulsar mass estimates. Although inclinations can be inferred from subtle features in optical light curves, such estimates may be systematically biased due to incomplete heating models and poorly understood variability. Using data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope, we have searched for gamma-ray eclipses from 49 spider systems, discovering significant eclipses in 7 systems, including the prototypical black widow PSR B1957+20. Gamma-ray eclipses require direct occultation of the pulsar by the companion, and so the detection, or significant exclusion, of a gamma-ray eclipse strictly limits the binary inclination angle, providing new robust, model-independent pulsar mass constraints. For PSR B1957+20, the eclipse implies a much lighter pulsar (1.81 ± 0.07 solar masses) than inferred from optical light curve modelling.},

Further examination of the folded light curve indicates the presence of narrow eclipses, suggesting that this is a redback binary system. An examination of the long-term properties of the modulation over 13 years of LAT observations indicates that the orbital modulation of the gamma rays changed from a simple eclipse before early 2013 to a broader, more easily detected quasi-sinusoidal modulation. In addition, the time of the eclipse shifts to ∼0.05 later in phase. This change in the orbital modulation properties, however, is not accompanied by a significant overall change in gamma-ray flux or spectrum. The quasi-sinusoidal component peaks ∼0.5 out of phase with the eclipse, which would indicate inferior conjunction of the compact object in the system. Swift X-ray Telescope observations reveal a possible X-ray counterpart within the LAT error ellipse. However, radio observations obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array do not detect a source in the region. 4FGL J1702.7−5655 appears to have changed its state in 2013, perhaps related to changes in the intrabinary shock in the system. We compare the properties of 4FGL J1702.7−5655 to those of other binary millisecond pulsars that have exhibited orbital modulation in gamma-rays.},

The properties of these millisecond pulsar binaries with low-mass, hydrogen-rich companions are discussed in the context of the 14 confirmed and 10 candidate field redbacks. We find that the neutron stars in redbacks have a median mass of 1.78 ± 0.09 M⊙ with a dispersion of σ = 0.21 ± 0.09. Neutron stars with masses in excess of 2 M⊙ are consistent with, but not firmly demanded by, current observations. Redback companions have median masses of 0.36 ± 0.04 M⊙ with a scatter of σ = 0.15 ± 0.04 M⊙, and a tail possibly extending up to 0.7–0.9 M⊙. Candidate redbacks tend to have higher companion masses than confirmed redbacks, suggesting a possible selection bias against the detection of radio pulsations in these more massive candidate systems. The distribution of companion masses between redbacks and the less massive black widows continues to be strongly bimodal, which is an important constraint on evolutionary models for these systems. Among redbacks, the median efficiency of converting the pulsar spin-down energy to γ-ray luminosity is ∼10\%.},

We discuss the computational challenges arising from the processing of the terabyte-sized survey data. Two new radio interference mitigation techniques are introduced, as well as a partially coherent segmented acceleration search algorithm which aims to increase our chances of discovering highly relativistic short-orbit binary systems, covering a parameter space including potential pulsar–black hole binaries. We show that under a constant acceleration approximation, a ratio of data length over orbital period of ≈0.1 results in the highest effectiveness for this search algorithm. From the 50 per cent of data processed thus far, we have redetected 435 previously known pulsars and discovered a further 60 pulsars, two of which are fast-spinning pulsars with periods less than 30 ms. PSR J1101−6424 is a millisecond pulsar whose heavy white dwarf (WD) companion and short spin period of 5.1 ms indicate a rare example of full-recycling via Case A Roche lobe overflow. PSR J1757−27 appears to be an isolated recycled pulsar with a relatively long spin period of 17 ms. In addition, PSR J1244−6359 is a mildly recycled binary system with a heavy WD companion, PSR J1755−25 has a significant orbital eccentricity of 0.09 and PSR J1759−24 is likely to be a long-orbit eclipsing binary with orbital period of the order of tens of years. Comparison of our newly discovered pulsar sample to the known population suggests that they belong to an older population. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our current pulsar detection yield is as expected from population synthesis.},

This work builds upon and supercedes the Taylor \& Cordes (1993) model by exploiting new observations and analysis methods. For lines of sight directed out of the Galactic plane, the new model yields substantially larger values for pulsar dispersion measures, except for directions dominated by the local hot bubble. Unlike the TC93 model, the new model provides sufficient electrons to account for the dispersion measures of the vast majority of known, Galactic pulsars. The new model is described and exemplified using plots of astronomically useful quantities on Galactic-coordinate grids. Software available on the Internet is also described. Future observations and analysis techniques that will improve the Galactic model are outlined.},

Parameters of the Galactic model are determined by fitting to 189 pulsars with independently determined distances and DMs. Simple models are used for the Magellanic Clouds and the IGM. Galactic model distances are within the uncertainty range for 86 of the 189 independently determined distances and within 20\% of the nearest limit for a further 38 pulsars. We estimate that 95\% of predicted Galactic pulsar distances will have a relative error of less than a factor of 0.9. The predictions of YMW16 are compared to those of the TC93 and NE2001 models showing that YMW16 performs significantly better on all measures. Timescales for pulse broadening due to interstellar scattering are estimated for (real or simulated) Galactic and Magellanic Cloud pulsars and FRBs.},

	abstract = {The paper reviews the principal methods which have been used in searching for and processing pulsar signals, with only a minimum amount of attention given to the physical implications of pulsar data. The fast folding algorithm (FFA) and fast Fourier transform (FFT) methods of period searching are described along with digital dispersion search techniques. The effect of interstellar dispersion on time resolution is studied, and the techniques of postdetection and predetection dispersion removal are compared. One section outlines resolution and sampling problems and the computation of the average pulse profile. Methods for polarization observations are reviewed, and the problems of variations of pulse intensity, covering time scales from microseconds to millions of years and radio frequency ranges from 40 MHz to 10 GHz, are explored.},
