	abstract = {Recent observations strongly suggest that the millisecond pulsar binary PSR J1023+0038 has developed an accretion disk since 2013 June. We present a multi-wavelength analysis of PSR J1023+0038, which reveals that (1) its gamma-rays suddenly brightened within a few days in 2013 June/July and has remained at a high gamma-ray state for several months; (2) both UV and X-ray fluxes have increased by roughly an order of magnitude; and (3) the spectral energy distribution has changed significantly after the gamma-ray sudden flux change. Time variabilities associated with UV and X-rays are on the order of 100–500 s and 50–100 s, respectively. Our model suggests that a newly formed accretion disk, due to the sudden increase of the stellar wind, could explain the changes of all these observed features. The increase of UV is emitted from the disk, and a new component in gamma-rays is produced by inverse Compton scattering between the new UV component and pulsar wind. The increase of X-rays results from the enhancement of injection pulsar wind energy into the intra-binary shock due to the increase of the stellar wind. We also predict that the radio pulses may be blocked by the evaporated winds from the disk, and the pulsar is still powered by rotation.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that, when the pressure within stellar matter becomes high enough, a new phase consisting of neutrons will be formed. In this paper we study the gravitational equilibrium of masses of neutrons, using the equation of state for a cold Fermi gas, and general relativity. For masses under 13⊙ only one equilibrium solution exists, which is approximately described by the nonrelativistic Fermi equation of state and Newtonian gravitational theory. For masses 13⊙{\textless}m{\textless}34⊙ two solutions exist, one stable and quasi-Newtonian, one more condensed, and unstable. For masses greater than 34⊙ there are no static equilibrium solutions. These results are qualitatively confirmed by comparison with suitably chosen special cases of the analytic solutions recently discovered by Tolman. A discussion of the probable effect of deviations from the Fermi equation of state suggests that actual stellar matter after the exhaustion of thermonuclear sources of energy will, if massive enough, contract indefinitely, although more and more slowly, never reaching true equilibrium.},

	abstract = {We present Chandra X-Ray Observatory imaging observations of the young Galactic supernova remnant G11.2-0.3. The image shows that the previously known young 65 ms X-ray pulsar is at position (J2000) R.A. 18h11m29.22s, decl. -19°25'27.6", with 1 σ error radius of 0.6". This is within 8" of the geometric center of the shell. This provides strong confirming evidence that the system is younger, by a factor of {\textasciitilde}12, than the characteristic age of the pulsar. The age discrepancy suggests that pulsar characteristic ages can be poor age estimators for young pulsars. Assuming conventional spin-down with constant magnetic field and braking index, the most likely explanation for the age discrepancy in G11.2-0.3 is that the pulsar was born with a spin period of {\textasciitilde}62 ms. The Chandra image also reveals, for the first time, the morphology of the pulsar wind nebula. The elongated hard X-ray structure can be interpreted as either a jet or a Crab-like torus seen edge-on. This adds to the growing list of highly aspherical pulsar wind nebulae and argues that such structures are common around young pulsars.},

For single stars, stellar winds are the only means of mass loss, and these are a function of the metallicity of the star. We discuss how metallicity, and a simplified prescription for its effect on mass loss, affects the evolution and final fate of massive stars. We map, as a function of mass and metallicity, where black holes and neutron stars are likely to form and where different types of supernovae are produced. Integrating over an initial mass function, we derive the relative populations as a function of metallicity. Provided that single stars rotate rapidly enough at death, we speculate on stellar populations that might produce gamma-ray bursts and jet-driven supernovae.},

	abstract = {The structure of neutron stars is considered from theoretical and observational perspectives. We demonstrate an important aspect of neutron star structure: the neutron star radius is primarily determined by the behavior of the pressure of matter in the vicinity of nuclear matter equilibrium density. In the event that extreme softening does not occur at these densities, the radius is virtually independent of the mass and is determined by the magnitude of the pressure. For equations of state with extreme softening or those that are self-bound, the radius is more sensitive to the mass. Our results show that in the absence of extreme softening, a measurement of the radius of a neutron star more accurate than about 1 km will usefully constrain the equation of state. We also show that the pressure near nuclear matter density is primarily a function of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy, while the nuclear incompressibility and skewness parameters play secondary roles. In addition, we show that the moment of inertia and the binding energy of neutron stars, for a large class of equations of state, are nearly universal functions of the star's compactness. These features can be understood by considering two analytic, yet realistic, solutions of Einstein's equations, by, respectively, Buchdahl and Tolman. We deduce useful approximations for the fraction of the moment of inertia residing in the crust, which is a function of the stellar compactness and, in addition, the pressure at the core-crust interface.},

	abstract = {The matter in neutron stars is essentially in its ground state and ranges in density up to and beyond 3 × 1014 g/cm3, the density of nuclear matter. Here we determine the constitution of the ground state of matter and its equation of state in the regime from 4.3 × 1011 g/cm3 where free neutrons begin to “drip” out of the nuclei, up to densities ≈ 5 × 1014 g/cm3, where standard nuclear-matter theory is still reliable. We describe the energy of nuclei in the free neutron regime by a compressible liquid-drop model designed to take into account three important features: (i) as the density increases, the bulk nuclear matter inside the nuclei, and the pure neutron gas outside the nuclei become more and more alike; (ii) the presence of the neutron gas reduces the nuclear surface energy; and (iii) the Coulomb interaction between nuclei, which keeps the nuclei in a lattice, becomes significant as the spacing between nuclei becomes comparable to the nuclear radius. We find that nuclei survive in the matter up to a density ∼ 2.4 × 1014 g/cm3; below this point we find no tendency for the protons to leave the nuclei. The transition between the phase with nuclei and the liquid phase at higher densities occurs as follows. The nuclei grow in size until they begin to touch; the remaining density inhomogeneity smooths out with increasing density until it disappears at about 3 × 1014 g/cm3 in a first-order transition. It is shown that the uniform liquid is unstable against density fluctuations below this density; the wave-length of the most unstable density fluctuation is close to the limiting lattice constant in the nuclear phase.},

Others relate directly to the physics of the pulsar and already shed some light on the properties of matter at high density (∼1015 g/cc) and in strong magnetic fields (∼1012 G). Pulsars are assumed to be rotating neutron stars surrounded by strong magnetic fields and energetic particles. It is somewhere within this "magnetosphere" that the pulsar action is expected to take place. Currently there has been considerable difficulty in formulating an entirely self-consistent theory of the magnetospheric behavior and there may be rapid revisions in the near future, which is all the more surprising since many of the issues involve "elementary" problems in electromagnetism. One interesting discovery is that charge-separated plasmas apparently can support stable static discontinuities.},

The PSC includes pulsar observers with expertise using the world's largest radio telescopes that together cover the full sky. We have performed very deep observations of all 35 pulsars discovered in blind frequency searches of the LAT data, resulting in the discovery of radio pulsations from four of them. We have also searched over 300 LAT gamma-ray sources that do not have strong associations with known gamma-ray emitting source classes and have pulsar-like spectra and variability characteristics. These searches have led to the discovery of a total of 43 new radio millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and four normal pulsars. These discoveries greatly increase the known population of MSPs in the Galactic disk, more than double the known population of so-called `black widow' pulsars, and contain many promising candidates for inclusion in pulsar timing arrays.},

The spatial location out of the Galactic plane and gamma-ray luminosity of the source are more consistent with classification as a recycled millisecond pulsar than as a young pulsar.

These are the most luminous flares seen in any non-accreting "spider" pulsar system, which may be related to the large size of the companion through the fraction of the pulsar wind that it or its ablated wind intercepts. Simultaneously with an optical flare, we see Balmer-line and He I emission, not previously known in this object, which is evidence of a stellar wind that may also inhibit detection of radio pulsations. The quiescent optical light curves, while dominated by ellipsoidal modulation, show evidence of variable non-uniform temperature that could be due either to large starspots or asymmetric heating of the companion by the pulsar. This may explain a previous measurement of unusual non-zero orbital eccentricity as, alternatively, distortion of the radial-velocity curve by the surface temperature distribution of the large companion.},

	abstract = {We have developed two new methods for finding binary pulsars that search complementary portions of parameter space. Both techniques examine small regions of the Fourier transform of a time series and identify the distinctive but very low signal-to-noise patterns produced by binary pulsars. The first technique is a Fourier-domain version of traditional "acceleration" searches which can coherently detect a binary pulsar if the orbital period is much longer than the observation time (Porb ≳ 10Tobs). Based on Fourier-domain matched filtering, it provides sensitivities similar to time domain versions, but with great computational advantages (i.e. greatly decreased memory usage, increased speed, and an inherently parallel nature) when the time series is very long ( ≳ 108 points). The second technique is a computationally "cheap" but incoherent search for binary pulsars where Porb ≲ ⅔Tobs. This search detects periodic sidebands created by orbital phase modulation of a binary pulsar's signal using a two-stage Fourier analysis. Sideband searches have the potential to detect very interesting exotic pulsar systems in ultra-compact binaries that would be impossible to detect using traditional techniques. We have implemented both searches along with many other advanced Fourier "tricks" into a suite of pulsar search software called PRESTO . Using this software we have discovered a very interesting 3 ms binary pulsar with a 102 m orbital period and a ∼10 MJupiter companion in the globular cluster NGC 6544, a most-likely isolated 4.71 ms pulsar in the globular cluster Terzan 5, and have confirmed the new 65.6 ms X-ray pulsar discovered in the supernova remnant 3C 58.},

Transitional systems that showed changes from rotation-powered to accretion-powered states and vice versa have bridged the populations of radio and accreting millisecond pulsars, eventually demonstrating the tight evolutionary link envisaged by the recycling scenario. A decade of discoveries and theoretical efforts have just grasped the complex phenomenology of transitional millisecond pulsars from the radio to the gamma-ray bands. This chapter summarizes the main properties of the three transitional millisecond pulsars discovered so far, as well as of candidates and related systems, discussing the various models proposed to cope with their multifaceted behaviour.},

A large fraction of these millisecond pulsars are in compact binaries with low-mass companions. These systems often show eclipses of the pulsar signal and are commonly known as black widows and redbacks because the pulsar is gradually destroying its companion. In this paper, we report on the optical discovery of four strongly irradiated millisecond pulsar companions. All four sources show modulations of their color and luminosity at the known orbital periods from radio timing. Light curve modeling of our exploratory data shows that the equilibrium temperature reached on the companion's dayside with respect to their nightside is consistent with about 10\%–30\% of the available spin-down energy from the pulsar being reprocessed to increase the companion's dayside temperature. This value compares well with the range observed in other irradiated pulsar binaries and offers insights about the energetics of the pulsar wind and the production of γ-ray emission. In addition, this provides a simple way of estimating the brightness of irradiated pulsar companions given the pulsar spin-down luminosity. Our analysis also suggests that two of the four new irradiated pulsar companions are only partially filling their Roche lobe. Some of these sources are relatively bright and represent good targets for spectroscopic follow-up. These measurements could enable, among other things, mass determination of the neutron stars in these systems.},

	abstract = {Reliable neutron star mass measurements are key to determining the equation of state of cold nuclear matter, but such measurements are rare. Black widows and redbacks are compact binaries consisting of millisecond pulsars and semi-degenerate companion stars. Spectroscopy of the optically bright companions can determine their radial velocities, providing inclination-dependent pulsar mass estimates. Although inclinations can be inferred from subtle features in optical light curves, such estimates may be systematically biased due to incomplete heating models and poorly understood variability. Using data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope, we have searched for gamma-ray eclipses from 49 spider systems, discovering significant eclipses in 7 systems, including the prototypical black widow PSR B1957+20. Gamma-ray eclipses require direct occultation of the pulsar by the companion, and so the detection, or significant exclusion, of a gamma-ray eclipse strictly limits the binary inclination angle, providing new robust, model-independent pulsar mass constraints. For PSR B1957+20, the eclipse implies a much lighter pulsar (1.81 ± 0.07 solar masses) than inferred from optical light curve modelling.},

Further examination of the folded light curve indicates the presence of narrow eclipses, suggesting that this is a redback binary system. An examination of the long-term properties of the modulation over 13 years of LAT observations indicates that the orbital modulation of the gamma rays changed from a simple eclipse before early 2013 to a broader, more easily detected quasi-sinusoidal modulation. In addition, the time of the eclipse shifts to ∼0.05 later in phase. This change in the orbital modulation properties, however, is not accompanied by a significant overall change in gamma-ray flux or spectrum. The quasi-sinusoidal component peaks ∼0.5 out of phase with the eclipse, which would indicate inferior conjunction of the compact object in the system. Swift X-ray Telescope observations reveal a possible X-ray counterpart within the LAT error ellipse. However, radio observations obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array do not detect a source in the region. 4FGL J1702.7−5655 appears to have changed its state in 2013, perhaps related to changes in the intrabinary shock in the system. We compare the properties of 4FGL J1702.7−5655 to those of other binary millisecond pulsars that have exhibited orbital modulation in gamma-rays.},

The properties of these millisecond pulsar binaries with low-mass, hydrogen-rich companions are discussed in the context of the 14 confirmed and 10 candidate field redbacks. We find that the neutron stars in redbacks have a median mass of 1.78 ± 0.09 M⊙ with a dispersion of σ = 0.21 ± 0.09. Neutron stars with masses in excess of 2 M⊙ are consistent with, but not firmly demanded by, current observations. Redback companions have median masses of 0.36 ± 0.04 M⊙ with a scatter of σ = 0.15 ± 0.04 M⊙, and a tail possibly extending up to 0.7–0.9 M⊙. Candidate redbacks tend to have higher companion masses than confirmed redbacks, suggesting a possible selection bias against the detection of radio pulsations in these more massive candidate systems. The distribution of companion masses between redbacks and the less massive black widows continues to be strongly bimodal, which is an important constraint on evolutionary models for these systems. Among redbacks, the median efficiency of converting the pulsar spin-down energy to γ-ray luminosity is ∼10\%.},

We discuss the computational challenges arising from the processing of the terabyte-sized survey data. Two new radio interference mitigation techniques are introduced, as well as a partially coherent segmented acceleration search algorithm which aims to increase our chances of discovering highly relativistic short-orbit binary systems, covering a parameter space including potential pulsar–black hole binaries. We show that under a constant acceleration approximation, a ratio of data length over orbital period of ≈0.1 results in the highest effectiveness for this search algorithm. From the 50 per cent of data processed thus far, we have redetected 435 previously known pulsars and discovered a further 60 pulsars, two of which are fast-spinning pulsars with periods less than 30 ms. PSR J1101−6424 is a millisecond pulsar whose heavy white dwarf (WD) companion and short spin period of 5.1 ms indicate a rare example of full-recycling via Case A Roche lobe overflow. PSR J1757−27 appears to be an isolated recycled pulsar with a relatively long spin period of 17 ms. In addition, PSR J1244−6359 is a mildly recycled binary system with a heavy WD companion, PSR J1755−25 has a significant orbital eccentricity of 0.09 and PSR J1759−24 is likely to be a long-orbit eclipsing binary with orbital period of the order of tens of years. Comparison of our newly discovered pulsar sample to the known population suggests that they belong to an older population. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our current pulsar detection yield is as expected from population synthesis.},

This work builds upon and supercedes the Taylor \& Cordes (1993) model by exploiting new observations and analysis methods. For lines of sight directed out of the Galactic plane, the new model yields substantially larger values for pulsar dispersion measures, except for directions dominated by the local hot bubble. Unlike the TC93 model, the new model provides sufficient electrons to account for the dispersion measures of the vast majority of known, Galactic pulsars. The new model is described and exemplified using plots of astronomically useful quantities on Galactic-coordinate grids. Software available on the Internet is also described. Future observations and analysis techniques that will improve the Galactic model are outlined.},

Parameters of the Galactic model are determined by fitting to 189 pulsars with independently determined distances and DMs. Simple models are used for the Magellanic Clouds and the IGM. Galactic model distances are within the uncertainty range for 86 of the 189 independently determined distances and within 20\% of the nearest limit for a further 38 pulsars. We estimate that 95\% of predicted Galactic pulsar distances will have a relative error of less than a factor of 0.9. The predictions of YMW16 are compared to those of the TC93 and NE2001 models showing that YMW16 performs significantly better on all measures. Timescales for pulse broadening due to interstellar scattering are estimated for (real or simulated) Galactic and Magellanic Cloud pulsars and FRBs.},

The effect of interstellar dispersion on time resolution is studied, and the techniques of postdetection and predetection dispersion removal are compared. One section outlines resolution and sampling problems and the computation of the average pulse profile. Methods for polarization observations are reviewed, and the problems of variations of pulse intensity, covering time scales from microseconds to millions of years and radio frequency ranges from 40 MHz to 10 GHz, are explored.},

	abstract = {The repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source FRB 20200120E is exceptional because of its proximity and association with a globular cluster. Here we report 60 bursts detected with the Effelsberg telescope at 1.4 GHz. We observe large variations in the burst rate, and report the first FRB 20200120E 'burst storm', where the source suddenly became active and 53 bursts (fluence ≥0.04 Jy ms) occurred within only 40 min. We find no strict periodicity in the burst arrival times, nor any evidence for periodicity in the source's activity between observations. The burst storm shows a steep energy distribution (power-law index α = 2.39 ± 0.12) and a bimodal wait-time distribution, with log-normal means of 0.94\${\textasciicircum}\{+0.07\}\_\{-0.06\}\$ s and 23.61\${\textasciicircum}\{+3.06\}\_\{-2.71\}\$ s. We attribute these wait-time distribution peaks to a characteristic event time-scale and pseudo-Poisson burst rate, respectively. The secondary wait-time peak at {\textasciitilde}1 s is {\textasciitilde}50 × longer than the {\textasciitilde}24 ms time-scale seen for both FRB 20121102A and FRB 20201124A - potentially indicating a larger emission region, or slower burst propagation. FRB 20200120E shows order-of-magnitude lower burst durations and luminosities compared with FRB 20121102A and FRB 20201124A. Lastly, in contrast to FRB 20121102A, which has observed dispersion measure (DM) variations of ΔDM {\textgreater} 1 pc cm-3 on month-to-year time-scales, we determine that FRB 20200120E's DM has remained stable (ΔDM {\textless} 0.15 pc cm-3) over {\textgreater}10 months. Overall, the observational characteristics of FRB 20200120E deviate quantitatively from other active repeaters, but it is unclear whether it is qualitatively a different type of source.},

On the one hand, within a few years it became clear that neutron star rotation gives rise to the extremely stable sequence of radio pulses, that the kinetic energy of rotation provides the reservoir of energy, and that electromagnetic fields are the braking mechanism. On the other hand, no consensus regarding the mechanism of coherent radio emission or the conversion of electromagnetic energy to particle energy yet exists. In this review, we report on three aspects of pulsar structure that have seen recent progress: the self-consistent theory of the magnetosphere of an oblique magnetic rotator; the location, geometry, and optics of radio emission; and evolution of the angle between spin and magnetic axes. These allow us to take the next step in understanding the physical nature of the pulsar activity.},

	abstract = {We report multiple lines of evidence for a stochastic signal that is correlated among 67 pulsars from the 15-year pulsar-timing data set collected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves. The correlations follow the Hellings-Downs pattern expected for a stochastic gravitational-wave background. The presence of such a gravitational-wave background with a power-law-spectrum is favored over a model with only independent pulsar noises with a Bayes factor in excess of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$, and this same model is favored over an uncorrelated common power-law-spectrum model with Bayes factors of 200-1000, depending on spectral modeling choices. We have built a statistical background distribution for these latter Bayes factors using a method that removes inter-pulsar correlations from our data set, finding \$p = 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ (approx. \$3{\textbackslash}sigma\$) for the observed Bayes factors in the null no-correlation scenario. A frequentist test statistic built directly as a weighted sum of inter-pulsar correlations yields \$p = 5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-5\} - 1.9 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ (approx. \$3.5 - 4{\textbackslash}sigma\$). Assuming a fiducial \$f{\textasciicircum}\{-2/3\}\$ characteristic-strain spectrum, as appropriate for an ensemble of binary supermassive black-hole inspirals, the strain amplitude is \$2.4{\textasciicircum}\{+0.7\}\_\{-0.6\} {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\}\$ (median + 90\% credible interval) at a reference frequency of 1/(1 yr). The inferred gravitational-wave background amplitude and spectrum are consistent with astrophysical expectations for a signal from a population of supermassive black-hole binaries, although more exotic cosmological and astrophysical sources cannot be excluded. The observation of Hellings-Downs correlations points to the gravitational-wave origin of this signal.},

Past studies have concentrated only on the very bright pulses or were insensitive to the faint end of the giant pulse luminosity distribution. With our new instrumentation offering a large bandwidth and high time resolution combined with the narrow radio beam of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT), we seek to probe the weak giant pulse emission regime. The WSRT was used in a phased array mode, resolving a large fraction of the Crab nebula. The resulting pulsar signal was recorded using the PuMa II pulsar backend and then coherently dedispersed and searched for giant pulse emission. After careful flux calibration, the data were analysed to study the giant pulse properties. The analysis includes the distributions of the measured pulse widths, intensities, energies, and scattering times. The weak giant pulses are shown to form a separate part of the intensity distribution. The large number of giant pulses detected were used to analyse scattering and scintillation in giant pulses. We report for the first time the detection of giant pulse emission at both the main- and interpulse phases within a single rotation period. The rate of detection is consistent with the appearance of pulses at either pulse phase as being independent. These pulse pairs were used to examine the scintillation timescales within a single pulse period.},

We performed wide-band simultaneous observations of four pulsars with LOFAR (at 40-190 MHz), the 76-m Lovell Telescope (at 1400 MHz) and the Effelsberg 100-m Telescope (at 8000 MHz) to test the accuracy of the dispersion law over a broad frequency range. In this paper we present the results of these observations which show that the dispersion law is accurate to better than 1 part in 105 across our observing band. We use this fact to constrain some of the properties of the interstellar medium along the line-of-sight and use the lack of any aberration or retardation effects to determine upper limits on emission heights in the pulsar magnetosphere. We also discuss the effect of pulse profile evolution on our observations, and the implications that it could have for precision pulsar timing projects such as the detection of gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays.},

	abstract = {We present a study of the spectral properties of 441 pulsars observed with the Parkes radio telescope near the centre frequencies of 728, 1382 and 3100 MHz. The observations at 728 and 3100 MHz were conducted simultaneously using the dual-band 10-50 cm receiver. These high-sensitivity, multifrequency observations provide a systematic and uniform sample of pulsar flux densities. We combine our measurements with spectral data from the literature in order to derive the spectral properties of these pulsars. Using techniques from robust regression and information theory, we classify the observed spectra in an objective, robust and unbiased way into five morphological classes: simple or broken power law, power law with either low- or high-frequency cut-off and log-parabolic spectrum. While about 79 per cent of the pulsars that could be classified have simple power-law spectra, we find significant deviations in 73 pulsars, 35 of which have curved spectra, 25 with a spectral break and 10 with a low-frequency turn-over. We identify 11 gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) pulsars, with 3 newly identified in this work and 8 confirmations of known GPS pulsars; 3 others show tentative evidence of GPS, but require further low-frequency measurements to support this classification. The weighted mean spectral index of all pulsars with simple power-law spectra is -1.60 ± 0.03. The observed spectral indices are well described by a shifted log-normal distribution. The strongest correlations of spectral index are with spin-down luminosity, magnetic field at the light-cylinder and spin-down rate. We also investigate the physical origin of the observed spectral features and determine emission altitudes for three pulsars.},

Here we report an analysis of archival low-frequency radio data that reveals a periodic, low-frequency radio transient. We find that the source pulses every 18.18 min, an unusual periodicity that has, to our knowledge, not been observed previously. The emission is highly linearly polarized, bright, persists for 30–60 s on each occurrence and is visible across a broad frequency range. At times, the pulses comprise short-duration ({\textless}0.5 s) bursts; at others, a smoother profile is observed. These profiles evolve on timescales of hours. By measuring the dispersion of the radio pulses with respect to frequency, we have localized the source to within our own Galaxy and suggest that it could be an ultra-long-period magnetar.},

	abstract = {Recently detected coherent low-frequency radio emission from M dwarf systems shares phenomenological similarities with emission produced by magnetospheric processes from the gas giant planets of our Solar System. Such beamed electron-cyclotron maser emission can be driven by a star-planet interaction or a breakdown in co-rotation between a rotating plasma disk and a stellar magnetosphere. Both models suggest that the radio emission could be periodic. Here we present the longest low-frequency interferometric monitoring campaign of an M dwarf system, composed of twenty-one ≈8 h epochs taken in two series of observing blocks separated by a year. We achieved a total on-source time of 6.5 days. We show that the M dwarf binary CR Draconis has a low-frequency 3{\textless}i{\textgreater}σ{\textless}i/{\textgreater} detection rate of 90 \% when a noise floor of ≈0.1 mJy is reached, with a median flux density of 0.92 mJy, consistent circularly polarised handedness, and a median circularly polarised fraction of 66\%. We resolve three bright radio bursts in dynamic spectra, revealing the brightest is elliptically polarised, confined to 4 MHz of bandwidth centred on 170 MHz, and reaches a flux density of 205 mJy. The burst structure is mottled, indicating it consists of unresolved sub-bursts. Such a structure shares a striking resemblance with the low-frequency emission from Jupiter. We suggest the near-constant detection of high brightness temperature, highly-circularly-polarised radiation that has a consistent circular polarisation handedness implies the emission is produced via the electron-cyclotron maser instability. Optical photometric data reveal the system has a rotation period of 1.984 ± 0.003 days. We observe no periodicity in the radio data, but the sampling of our radio observations produces a window function that would hide the near two-day signal.},
