	abstract = {Observations of interplanetary scintillation (IPS - the scintillation of compact radio sources due to density variations in the solar wind) enable the velocity of the solar wind to be determined, and its bulk density to be estimated, throughout the inner heliosphere. A series of observations using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR - a radio telescope centred on the Netherlands with stations across Europe) were undertaken using this technique to observe the passage of an ultra-fast CME which launched from the Sun following the X-class flare of 10 September 2017. LOFAR observed the strong radio source 3C147 at an elongation of 82 degrees from the Sun over a period of more than 30 hours and observed a strong increase in speed to 900km/s followed two hours later by a strong increase in the level of scintillation, interpreted as a strong increase in density. Both speed and density remained enhanced for a period of more than seven hours, to beyond the period of observation. Further analysis of these data demonstrates a view of magnetic-field rotation due to the passage of the CME, using advanced IPS techniques only available to a unique instrument such as LOFAR.},

	abstract = {We present observations of high-amplitude rapid (2 s) variability toward two bright, compact extragalactic radio sources out of several hundred of the brightest radio sources in one of the 30{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ × 30{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Epoch of Reionization fields using the MWA at 155 MHz. After rejecting intrinsic, instrumental, and ionospheric origins we consider the most likely explanation for this variability to be interplanetary scintillation (IPS), likely the result of a large coronal mass ejection propagating from the Sun. This is confirmed by roughly contemporaneous observations with the Ooty Radio Telescope. We see evidence for structure on spatial scales ranging from {\textless}1000 to \{10\}6 km. The serendipitous night-time nature of these detections illustrates the new regime that the MWA has opened for IPS studies with sensitive night-time, wide-field, low-frequency observations. This regime complements traditional dedicated strategies for observing IPS and can be utilized in real-time to facilitate dedicated follow-up observations. At the same time, it allows large-scale surveys for compact (arcsec) structures in low-frequency radio sources despite the 2{\textbackslash}prime resolution of the array.},

	abstract = {Observation of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) beyond Earth-orbit can be challenging due to the necessity to use low radio frequencies at which scintillation due to the ionosphere could confuse the interplanetary contribution. A recent paper by Kaplan et al. presenting observations using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) reports evidence of nightside IPS on two radio sources within their field of view. However, the low time cadence of 2 s used might be expected to average out the IPS signal, resulting in the reasonable assumption that the scintillation is more likely to be ionospheric in origin. To check this assumption, this Letter uses observations of IPS taken at a high time cadence using the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). Averaging these to the same as the MWA observations, we demonstrate that the MWA result is consistent with IPS, although some contribution from the ionosphere cannot be ruled out. These LOFAR observations represent the first of nightside IPS using LOFAR, with solar wind speeds consistent with a slow solar wind stream in one observation and a coronal mass ejection expected to be observed in another.},

	abstract = {The measurement of the spatial fluctuations of the neutral hydrogen 21 cm signal arising during the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn periods of our Universe (z from 200 to 10) holds the potential to resolve these still-unexplored earliest phases of the evolution of matter structures. As these cosmological signals are very weak, large distributed telescopes are required at locations free from terrestrial radio interference and ionospheric disturbances. This paper presents a description of the scientific aims, the instrumental concept, and technological developments of an experiment - dubbed the Dark-ages EXplorer (DEX) - which would allow us to (a) measure the Global Signal and (b) measure the angular density fluctuations and conduct line-of-sight tomography in the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn epochs. Additional scientific goals are also briefly described. The experiment consists of a low-frequency radio interferometer, which should ideally be located on the far side of the Moon. The paper presents findings from an ESA Concurrent Design Facility (CDF) study, which was conducted to assess the feasibility of such a system using present-day technologies with a high TRL (Technology Readiness Level). Although the study finds that the number of antennas needed to achieve the primary scientific goals is not yet feasible at the moment, it points to a path of technological development that can lead to a realistic and valuable experiment in the medium-term future (i.e., the next decade(s)), as well as development of multi-purpose use technology that can be applied on Earth, and towards other lunar operations.},
